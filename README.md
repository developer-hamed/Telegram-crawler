# Telegram-Scrawler

Telegram public channel posts are on telegram.me/NAME/POST_ID
and by opening such a url you can see channel's posts without
using a telegram app and having telegram account.
This program finds correct post links of entered channel in a
specific range and writes them to a txt file.

Note:This Script needs permision to create a file so you need
to grant this permision and then you can run it.
